# BlockNote Editor for Swift

## About BlockNote Editor for Swift

This repository implements a Swift package that wraps the open source [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org/) library in a Swift package and exposes the library to macOS and iOS applications using web views in AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI. The BlockNote editor is a React-based HTML editor that presents a text editing experience where documents can be composed from _blocks_. Blocks can be paragraphs, block quotes, code snippets, videos, images, structural elements such as columns, charts, and other elements. The goal of this package is to bring this rich text editing experience to Swift-based applications for macOS, iPad, and iPhone.
